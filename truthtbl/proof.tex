Theorem: A truth table covering n variables (where n is a positive integer) has
$2^n$ rows.

Proof by induction: First, we see that a single-variable truth table has two
rows: one for truth and one for falsehood. Suppose a truth table with k
variables has $2^k$ rows. Then there are $2^k$ unique combinations of truth and
falsehood for those k variables. Suppose we add another variable to the table,
giving it (k+1) variables. Now for each unique combination in the table before
modification, our new variable can be either true or false, replacing each
combination with two potential unique combinations, so that we now have $2*2^k$
total combinations, or $2^{k+1}$. Thus we may conclude that if this property
holds for k, then it holds for (k+1). Since the property holds for k=1, we know
it holds for all of the positive integers. Thus, for any positive integer n, a
truth table covering n variables has $2^n$ rows.
